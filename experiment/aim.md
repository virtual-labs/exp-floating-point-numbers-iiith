Many scientific applications involve computations involving just not integers but also real numbers. In computers we cannot precisely represent all of the real numbers. However we can still have a useful and effective representation of them with certain loss in precision.

In this lab we shall understand the basic concepts of Floating Point Numbers and their conversion to and from decimal form.
